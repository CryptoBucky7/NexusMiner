The FPGA accepts work packets from software via USB UART and returns 64 bit nonce candidates.
UART settings: 230400 8-N-1
When there is a new block, the software sends the FPGA a 224 byte work packet in raw (not ascii) format over the UART.
The first 136 bytes is the hash midstate which is used as the Key for the next part of the hash.  
The key is followed by the final 88 bytes of the block header.

Upon receipt of a new header the FPGA will immediately search the space for a nonce that results in a hash with 32 leading zeros.  
The starting nonce is specified by the last 8 bytes of the work packet. 
The FPGA search proceeds by incrementing the nonce by 1
When it finds a nonce it sends it over the UART to the software (8 bytes).
The actual difficulty is likely greater than 32 bits, so the software must check if the nonce actually solves the block and should filter out bad blocks.
The number of nonces received over time can be used as a performance gage.  The hash rate in Megahashes per second can be calculated as nonces_received * (2^32)/1e6/eleapsed_seconds.

After sending a work packet over the uart, the software shall wait at least 20ms before sending a new work packet to the same port.
The entire work packet must be transmitted to the FPGA within 20ms of receiving the first byte. 
Although unlikely, the FPGA may transmit multiple nonces in succession without a gap.
